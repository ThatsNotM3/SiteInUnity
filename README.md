# :wave: Welcome!
This is a GitHub Page of the "SiteInUnity" project. The project itself is a video series on my channel where I am trying to make a real, fully-interactable "Website", but... in Unity!

## :briefcase: How can you contribute
Everyone who knows Unity or C# can contribute to this project. Things you can do:
* Add features, scenes(tabs) and any other content.
* Fix and improve the existing code.
* Find and fix bugs in the app itself.

We are going to create lots of utilities and mini-games, so that the project will be bigger, funnier and enjoyable. If you have experience or ideas, you can greatly help us with that. Every author will be mentioned on his work's page (like *"Calculator Tool. Made by ThatsNotM3"*) and in my new video as well. Any contribution will be appreciated!
